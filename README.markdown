Teamworker
==========

This Rails web application has originated to help solve two specific problems that are common in technology departments:

1. Ensure that the people supply is balanced against demand for work to be done
2. Manage budget (FTE) for projects in progress

There are many different ways of doing this already (Excel in particular!), but nothing has really adequately met our needs because we have significantly changed our operating model at work towards:

* Teams over individuals
* Releases over projects

This philosophical change highlighted that many of our business processes and systems are geared the other way around which although may be easier to manage, they ultimately lead to a significant amount of waste.  It was because of this that we have seen a need for Teamworker - a tool to support our new way of operating.

Along the way it will hopefully also provide assistance for other related areas:

* People skills and roles
* Scrum team performance (days/point)
* Timesheeting for teams (as opposed to individuals)
* Release supply capacity

The application is in its infancy and not ready for consumption yet.  I'll update the README file when its in working order!
